class DocumentResource(index.IndexResource):
    """
    A modified version of :class:`.IndexResource` providing generalized
    RETRIEVE, UPDATE and DELETE operations for individual documents in MongoDB.

    This class is designed to operate as an abstract class and should not
    be instantiated by itself. In order to perform CRUD operations on a
    document, a child of :class:`~DocumentResource` should be defined as
    the class variable `_document_resource` in a corresponding child of
    :class:`~CollectionResource` set up to access a specific collection.

    :class:`~DocumentResource` is essentially a wrapper for interacting with
    a `mongoengine` back-end. As such, it does not attempt to serialize or
    prepare any data for back-end work. It will, however, aggressively
    instantiate results into :class:`~Document` objects.

    As a final note, this class is designed to accept raw ``pymongo`` queries.
    Future versions are planned to accept higher level ``mongoengine`` options
    as well.

    WARNING: The methods in this class implicitly trust whatever data you throw
    at them. They were created with the assumption that user data will have
    already been parsed and sanitized at the view-level before it is passed
    back to lower-level systems. Do not shove untrusted queries into these
    methods.
